holotrack is a facetracking software for Live2D-based models using [osu!framework](https://github.com/ppy/osu-framework). Unlike most solutions, holotrack is:

- Built always on the latest C# standards - Made with osu!framework, a game engine that powers [osu!lazer](https://github.com/ppy/osu), the next iteration of osu!.
- Open source, from the very core - holotrack is completely free and open source. No gotchas. 
- Always evolving - holotrack improves every update, and it tries to know you better too, literally.
